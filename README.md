# Music Box
This project is a music box/drumpad allowing users to unleash their creativity and create music on the fly.
The nine pad buttons are each mapped to a different sound, which gives users a lot of flexibility what they want to achieve.
The application can be toggled using the switch at the top, and the status is observable throught the red button besides that switch.
There is also a display allowing users to see the name of the sound/instrument linked to each button.
